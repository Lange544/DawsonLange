    <h1>The Impact of Cinematic Universes: How Marvel, DC, and Beyond Changed Movies </h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> The Age of Cinematic Universes </h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            In recent years, cinematic universes have redefined the way movies are made and experienced.
         Franchises like the <strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</strong> and the <strong>DC Extended Universe (DCEU)</strong> have proven that interconnected storytelling can lead to massive box-office success and devoted fanbases.
         But what makes these universes so appealing? And how have they reshaped the entire movie industry?
         </p>

         <p><blockquote>“The biggest difference between a film franchise and a cinematic universe is that the universe offers the opportunity to tell a much broader story.” </blockquote>
        <cite><strong>-Kevin Feige</strong>, President of Marvel Studios</cite>

        <h2>The Power of Shared Worlds</h2>
        <p> For many fans, this concept of a shared universe is a major draw. It allows for intricate storylines and deeper character development over time. 
            The narrative arcs aren’t confined to a single movie but rather unfold across years, allowing for unexpected twists, long-term character growth, and a payoff that spans multiple films.

        <h2>The Finanacial Revolution</h2> 
        <p>Beyond fan engagement, cinematic universes have had a profound effect on the financial side of the movie industry.
             With interconnected films, studios can draw in a wide range of audiences—those loyal to individual characters, those who love the crossover events, and those who simply enjoy blockbuster spectacles. 
            This approach has turned franchises like <em>Marvel</em> and <em>DC</em> into near-guaranteed box-office draws <em>Marvel Studios'</em> approach has shown how a well-executed cinematic universe can not only drive box-office revenue but also create a sustainable franchise ecosystem. 
                According to The Hollywood Reporter, the MCU has grossed over $22 billion at the global box office, making it one of the most financially successful film franchises of all time.
                 This success has caused other studios to reconsider how they approach their own cinematic universes.
                </p>
        <p><blockquote>“I think what <em>Marvel</em> has done is brilliant, it’s reinvented the playbook,It’s all about careful planning, risk-taking, and creating characters that audiences care about.
             That’s how you build something lasting.”</blockquote>
