            <h2>A little about me <H2></H2>
            My name is Dawson Lange , I am a first year student here at southeast tech. I am currently working full-time at Benchmark electronics as a Repair Operator. When im not working or studying i usually like to spend my free time excersizing and watching movies. I love to travel, recently I traveled to South Dakota and visited the Black hills forest and Badlands where we hiked "The Notch Trail". It was absolutley beautiful!

                 I was born and raised in Rochester, Minnesota, where I eventually moved and lived in Portales, New Mexico, for two and a half years. I thought New Mexico was a great adventure, but I had to come back to Minnesota. So then I moved here to Winona, Minnesota, where I now live with my girlfriend Caitlyn and our two pets: a tuxedo cat named Maisy and a heeler named Videl.

                <P>
                    I hope when I am finished with this course. I will be able to Understand fluently how to use the various coding structures we will use in this class to be able to design websites fluidly and without many errors! I would like to be able to go to a website and fully understand how they went about deisnging that website.
